            My fitness journey started after years of being bullied for being overweight as a teenager.
            It knocked my self-confidence down tremendously.
            I decided to RENEW myself and took action.
            I fell in love with the result and from that point I want to help others to achieve the same result.
            I've been a certified trainer for 5 years.
            I graduated with BS in Kinesiology from East Central University.
